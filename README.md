For this project to work, make sure to do these steps:

1. Make new inbound rule for the port (e.g. port 3) that you are using in Windows Defender Firewall 
    a. If it does not work, just temporarily turn off Windows defender on the network that you are working
2. You have to run unity first on the second pc, before you run client on the 1st pc
